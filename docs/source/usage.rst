scrnatools provides helper plotting and analysis functions built on top of the scanpy and scVI packages 
to perform common tasks in scRNA-seq analysis pipelines. Extensive description of general best practices 
and detailed default pipeline examples can be found in the scanpy and scvi-tools documentation. For an 
example walkthrough of a typical scRNA-seq pipeline and the added functionality provided by scrnatools
